## Natural Language Processing with Hugging Face Transformers
#### _Author : @Svitlana Kramar__

## Information Project üîé
This Guided Project will walk you through some of the applications of Hugging Face Transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Hugging Face Transformers 
provide pre-trained models for a variety of applications in NLP and Computer Vision.
For example, these models are widely used in near real-time translation tasks, opening communication spaces to language-diverse and hearing-impaired audiences. 
In this project, you will learn and practice applying these models to do text summarization, sentiment classification, translation, generate new text, and extract information from text.
